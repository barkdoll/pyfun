Total Energy Expenditure(TEE) from Physical Activity Level (PAL):
=================================================================
* For "Sedentary" lifestyle, Total Energy Expenditure = Basal Metabolic Rate * PPAL_SEDENTARY = 1971.49 x 1.53 = 3016.38 calories per day
* For "Active" lifestyle, Total Energy Expenditure = Basal Metabolic Rate * PAL_ACTIVE = 1971.49 x 1.76 = 3469.82 calories per day
* For "Vigorous" lifestyle, Total Energy Expenditure = Basal Metabolic Rate * PPAL_VIGOROUS = 1971.49 x 2.25 = 4435.85 calories per day

Let off some steam, Bennett!
